# WTG Parser

This is a Java project to read and write WTG Files.

WTG Files are a file specification created by Blizzard Entertainment to represent graphical trigger data in the game WarCraft III.

Huge thanks to Ralle from TheHiveWorkshop for breaking this format open and publishing a detailed spec on it. This spec has been included in this repo, in the "docs" folder. This is the source: https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/warcraft-3-trigger-format-specification-wtg.294491/
